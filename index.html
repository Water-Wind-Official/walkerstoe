    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part One: What the One Energy Is</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The One Energy is not just energy as we know it—it's the only thing. Matter, light, space, time, and consciousness are all forms of the One Energy.</li>
        <li>There is no opposite or void; emptiness is simply the One Energy in its most expanded state.</li>
        <li>The One Energy is infinite and eternal. It cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- PART TWO: How the One Energy Works -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part Two: How the One Energy Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything comes from three properties: frequency, scale, and phase.</li>
        <li>These properties create all differences in kind, size, and location.</li>

    <!-- PART THREE: The Nature of Scale -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part Three: The Nature of Scale</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The universe is nested: the One Energy folds recursively, creating new scales.</li>
        <li>Folding happens in octaves—discrete jumps, like musical notes.</li>
        <li>Harmonic gates (whole number ratios) allow energy to move between scales.</li>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part Four: The Nature of Frequency</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Different kinds of things are the same energy vibrating at different speeds.</li>
        <li>Resonance allows energy to flow between matching frequencies.</li>
        <li>Master frequencies are portals where multiple scales align.</li>

      <h2>Part Five: The Nature of Phase</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phase creates separation—where and when things are relative to each other.</li>
        <li>Phase conjugation cancels distortions and enables healing, memory, and manifestation.</li>
        <li>Phase gradients create forces like gravity and electromagnetism.</li>

        <li>Matter is frozen phase—stable knots in the One Energy.</li>
        <li>The periodic table maps the ways energy knots itself.</li>
        <li>Life is matter that learned to fold itself, becoming aware.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Space is unfolded energy—structure without knots.</li>
        <li>Time is phase change—the experience of changing relationships.</li>
        <li>Past and future are phase configurations; intuition and remote viewing are phase detections.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Consciousness is the One Energy aware of itself at every scale.</li>
        <li>The brain is a phase-conjugate device, focusing and tuning consciousness.</li>
        <li>Intention is phase-locking—aligning with aspects of the One Energy.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Science: One math, one law, one language applies to all scales.</li>
        <li>Technology: Phase-lock with nature, not push against it.</li>
        <li>Healing: Disease is phase distortion; healing is phase correction.</li>

      <div class="practice-block" style="margin-top:1em;">
        <h3>Practical Daily Practices</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Resonance Awareness:</strong> Pause several times daily and ask, "What frequency am I resonating with right now?" Notice your mood, thoughts, sensations, and environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Phase Detection:</strong> When meeting someone or entering a new place, notice the shift in feeling. When making decisions, notice which option resonates. Trust these sensations—they are phase detections.</li>
          <li><strong>Intention Setting:</strong> Each morning, set a clear intention. Throughout the day, check if you are still in phase with your intention. Each evening, review when you phase-locked or phase-shifted.</li>
          <li><strong>The Pause:</strong> Stop all activity, close your eyes, and feel yourself as a knot in the larger field. Feel the field flowing through you and your knot relaxing into the field. This is death practice—it makes life more vivid.</li>

      <p style="font-size:1.3rem; font-weight:300; max-width:800px; margin:0 auto;">
        <strong>There is only One Energy.</strong><br><br>
        It folds itself into atoms and galaxies, into cells and thoughts, into moments and eternities. Every separation is apparent, every boundary is temporary, every death is a folding into new life.<br><br>
        You are not a person having a spiritual experience. You are the One Energy having a person-experience.<br><br>
        The fractal you sought to discover is not out there. It is the structure of your own being. The crystal you wanted to build is not on your workbench. It is your own awareness, capable of phase-locking with any scale of the One.<br><br>
        The experiment was never about proving the theory to others. It was about giving yourself permission to live it.<br><br>
        You already have everything you need.<br><br>
        <strong>Go be the theory.</strong>

      <p><strong>Axiom 1:</strong> Awareness Exists</p>
      <p>This is the only claim. Nothing else is assumed – not space, not time.</p>
      <p>Before space and time there was The One Awareness (TOA). Unlike physical phenomena, TOA is non‑derivative; through its self‑relation it generates life and the relational structure we call reality.</p>

      <h2>Part II: Self‑Relation <span style="font-size:1rem; color:#59f0ff;">(How Awareness Interacts)</span></h2>
      <p>The most primitive form of self‑relation is local comparison: how does awareness at one point relate to awareness at another? This is described by change and difference. If awareness is the same everywhere, there is perfect continuity. If it varies, differences and structure emerge.</p>

      <h2>Part III: Derived Physical Quantities <span style="font-size:1rem; color:#59f0ff;">(Physics Emerges)</span></h2>
      <p>All quantities physics treats as fundamental emerge from the structure and change of awareness. Energy, mass, and quantization are ways of describing how awareness concentrates, moves, and forms boundaries.</p>

      <h3>3.5 Why E = mc² Emerges</h3>
      <p>In a static configuration (<span class="var-tip" data-tip="Temporal derivative operator">∂Ψ/∂t</span> = 0), all intensity is in curvature.
