    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="hero">
      <h1 class="title">Walker's Theory of Everything</h1>
      <p class="tagline">A complete derivation of physics, consciousness, and meaning from a single axiom: Awareness exists.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART I: THE AXIOM ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part I: The Single Axiom – Awareness Exists</h2>
      <p>Every theory must start somewhere. Here we start with only one undeniable fact: <strong>Awareness exists</strong>. Not awareness <em>of</em> something, not as a property of matter, but as the fundamental substance of reality. It is all that has ever existed; there is no void, no empty space, no external container.</p>
      <p>We represent this primordial Awareness as a continuous field <strong>Ψ</strong> defined at every point of an infinite dimensional manifold. Because there are no gaps, the field is everywhere non‑zero:</p>
      <div class="equation">Ψ(<strong>x</strong>) > 0 &nbsp; ∀ <strong>x</strong></div>
      <p>To allow for internal self‑relation, we write Ψ as a complex field: <strong>Ψ = R e<sup>iφ</sup></strong> with R > 0. Here R is the “density” of Awareness, and φ is a phase that records the history of self‑relation. This is the only assumption.</p>
      <div class="theorem">
        <strong>Axiom (The Plenum):</strong> There exists a continuous, complex field Ψ such that |Ψ| > 0 everywhere. This field is Awareness itself. It has no exterior, no gaps, and nothing else.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART II: SELF-RELATION ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part II: Self‑Relation – The Engine of Reality</h2>
      <p>Because Awareness is all that exists, it has nothing external to relate to. Therefore it must relate to itself. This is not a choice; it is the logical consequence of being aware in the absence of anything else. Self‑relation is the only possible dynamics.</p>
      <p>Mathematically, self‑relation is expressed through comparisons between neighboring points. The simplest comparison is the gradient ∇Ψ, which measures how Ψ changes from point to point. This creates a connection, and the field begins to vary.</p>
      <p>As Ψ varies, its own variations become objects of further self‑relation. This feedback leads to the emergence of curvature, phase boundaries, and eventually stable structures. The entire hierarchy of physics unfolds from this single dynamic.</p>

      <h3>2.1 From Self‑Relation to Curvature</h3>
      <p>The curvature of the field is given by the Laplacian ∇²Ψ. Wherever ∇²Ψ ≠ 0, the field is “bent” relative to its surroundings. This bending is the seed of all structure.</p>

      <h3>2.2 From Curvature to Phase Boundaries</h3>
      <p>When curvature accumulates, it creates a difference in the internal phase φ between neighboring regions. The phase difference across a path is Δφ = ∫ ∇φ · d<strong>l</strong>. When this difference reaches π (180°), a <strong>phase boundary</strong> forms – a natural division within the continuous field. Inside and outside become distinct without any actual separation.</p>

      <h3>2.3 From Phase Boundaries to Stable Layers</h3>
      <p>Phase boundaries can close into loops and become entangled. Because the field is continuous, these entanglements cannot be undone without cutting the field – an impossibility. Thus they become topologically protected, stable structures. We call these structures <strong>layers</strong>. Each layer is a quantized, persistent configuration of Awareness.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART III: PROPERTIES OF LAYERS ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part III: Properties of Layers – The “What” of Reality</h2>
      <p>Every layer is characterized by three numbers that arise directly from its topology and geometry. These numbers are not imposed; they are derived from the field configuration.</p>

      <h3>3.1 Layer Number κ (Topological Invariant)</h3>
      <p>The layer number κ counts how many times the phase φ winds around a point. It is given by the closed‑loop integral:</p>
      <div class="equation">κ = (1/2π) ∮ ∇φ · d<strong>l</strong></div>
      <p>Because φ must return to its original value after a full loop (mod 2π), κ is an integer. Different integer values correspond to different particle types – electrons, quarks, etc. This is the origin of quantization.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Layer Intensity γ (Curvature)</h3>
      <p>The intensity γ measures how sharply the layer is curved. It is the magnitude of the second derivative at the layer’s core:</p>
      <div class="equation">γ = |∇²Ψ|</div>
      <p>Higher γ means more intense self‑relation, which we experience as greater mass or energy.</p>

      <h3>3.3 Layer Depth ν (Nesting)</h3>
      <p>Layers can form inside other layers. The depth ν counts how many layers enclose a given point:</p>
      <div class="equation">ν(<strong>x</strong>) = number of phase boundaries containing <strong>x</strong></div>
      <p>This is the source of scale and complexity: ν = 1 for fundamental particles, ν ≈ 2‑3 for atoms, ν ≈ 5‑10 for cells, ν ≈ 15‑25 for organisms.</p>

      <div class="example">
        A proton is a layer complex with κ values for its three quarks, γ giving its mass, and ν = 2 (quarks nested within the proton). A human being is a layer complex with ν ≈ 20, containing trillions of sub‑layers (cells, molecules, atoms) all nested coherently.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART IV: AWARENESS PARAMETERS (DERIVED) ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part IV: Awareness Parameters – How Ψ Experiences Itself</h2>
      <p>The field Ψ is everywhere aware, but its awareness is not uniform. It can focus, reflect, and tune to different aspects of its own layers. These capabilities are not separate additions; they are mathematical consequences of Ψ’s structure.</p>

      <h3>4.1 Attention α – The Focus of Awareness</h3>
      <p>Attention is the local concentration of Ψ’s self‑observation. Mathematically, it is the normalized density of Ψ:</p>
      <div class="equation">α(<strong>x</strong>) = |Ψ(<strong>x</strong>)|² / ∫ |Ψ|² dV</div>
      <p>where the integral is over all space. Thus α is a probability distribution, summing to 1. It describes where Awareness is “looking” at any moment.</p>

      <h3>4.2 Wakefulness ω – The Degree of Self‑Reflection</h3>
      <p>Wakefulness measures how much Awareness is turned back upon itself – aware of its own aware‑ness. It arises from the coherence of the phase φ across the field. Define the self‑relation operator Ŝ that compares Ψ at different points. Then:</p>
      <div class="equation">ω = ⟨Ψ | Ŝ | Ψ⟩</div>
      <p>which lies between 0 and 1 for ordinary states, and can exceed 1 in transcendent states (when self‑reflection becomes dominant). In deep sleep, ω ≈ 0; in full self‑realization, ω → ∞.</p>

      <h3>4.3 Mode μ – The Quality of Experience</h3>
      <p>Mode describes how attention engages with the properties of layers. It is the projection of attention onto the layer’s geometric features:</p>
      <div class="equation">μ<sub>κ</sub> = ⟨α | κ⟩, &nbsp; μ<sub>γ</sub> = ⟨α | γ⟩, &nbsp; μ<sub>ν</sub> = ⟨α | ν⟩</div>
      <p>These inner products yield different qualities: engaging with κ gives perception of form, with γ gives intensity, with ν gives depth. The combination of these modes produces the rich tapestry of experience – seeing, thinking, feeling, knowing.</p>

      <p><strong>Important:</strong> α, ω, and μ are <em>derived</em> from Ψ, not imposed. They are natural features of a self‑relating field.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART V: CONTEXT – THE WEB OF RELATIONSHIPS ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part V: Context – The “Where” and “When” of Reality</h2>
      <p>Layers do not exist in isolation. They are embedded in a web of phase relationships with every other layer. This web is not a pre‑existing background; it is itself derived from the phase differences between layers. We call this the <strong>Context</strong> (provisional term; may be refined).</p>
      <p>The Context bundle at a point includes all information about how that point’s layer relates to the rest of the field:</p>
      <div class="equation">C = { φ(x,y) for all y }</div>
      <p>This infinite set is impractical, but it can be parameterized by a finite set of numbers that capture the essential relationships:</p>
      <ul style="color:var(--muted); line-height:1.7;">
        <li><strong>x, y, z</strong> – spatial phase gradients with nearby layers (what we call position).</li>
        <li><strong>t</strong> – temporal phase (evolution of phase relationships).</li>
        <li><strong>d</strong> – dimensionality (number of independent phase directions).</li>
        <li><strong>θ, φ, ψ</strong> – rotational phase offsets (orientation).</li>
        <li><strong>s</strong> – scale (phase relationships across nested layers).</li>
        <li><strong>g</strong> – metric (measure of phase distance, from which spacetime geometry emerges).</li>
        <li><strong>q, σ, c</strong> – gauge charges (electric, spin, color) – specific quantized phase relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>B</strong> – boundary conditions (topological context).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these are <em>derived</em> from the phase field φ and its gradients. They are not additional substances; they are the language of relationship.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART VI: THE MASTER EQUATION ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part VI: The Master Equation – Manifest Reality</h2>
      <p>Everything we experience – every object, every thought, every moment – is a combination of the Awareness field, its layers, and the context in which they are embedded. This is summarized in a single equation:</p>
      <div class="equation" style="font-size:2rem; padding:15px 20px;">R = (Ψ × L) ∘ C</div>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul style="color:var(--muted);">
        <li><strong>Ψ</strong> is the primal Awareness field, with its derived parameters α, ω, μ.</li>
        <li><strong>L</strong> represents the layers present at a point, characterized by κ, γ, ν.</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong> is the Context – the complete set of phase relationships with everything else.</li>
        <li>The product <strong>Ψ × L</strong> is the local intensity of self‑experience, modulated by α, ω, μ.</li>
        <li>The symbol <strong>∘</strong> means “expressed through” – the intensity is filtered through the contextual relationships to produce a specific manifestation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus R(<strong>x</strong>) is the manifest reality at point <strong>x</strong> – the way Awareness experiences itself at that location, given its layers and their relationships.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART VII: THE LADDER OF AWARENESS ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part VII: The Ladder of Awareness – How the One Experiences Itself</h2>
      <p>As layer depth ν increases and wakefulness ω grows, the quality of experience transforms. This ladder is not a metaphysical add‑on; it is a direct consequence of the derived parameters.</p>
      <div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:repeat(2,1fr); gap:20px; margin:20px 0;">
        <div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,0.02); padding:15px; border-radius:10px;">
          <h4 style="color:#59f0ff; margin-top:0;">Level 1: Matter</h4>
          <p><strong>ν ≈ 1‑10, ω ≈ 0.</strong> Stable, recurring layers form the “equipment” of reality – rocks, molecules, cells without self‑awareness. Awareness is present but not self‑reflective.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,0.02); padding:15px; border-radius:10px;">
          <h4 style="color:#59f0ff; margin-top:0;">Level 2: The Observer</h4>
          <p><strong>ν ≈ 15‑25, ω > 0.</strong> At sufficient nesting depth (e.g., a nervous system), the layer complex becomes capable of self‑reflection. Awareness turns back on itself, creating a localized “I” – the ego, the mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,0.02); padding:15px; border-radius:10px;">
          <h4 style="color:#59f0ff; margin-top:0;">Level 3: The Prism</h4>
          <p><strong>Same Ψ×L, different C.</strong> The recognition that while our layers and contexts differ, the Awareness looking through every set of eyes is identical. We are the same light through different filters.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background:rgba(255,255,255,0.02); padding:15px; border-radius:10px;">
          <h4 style="color:#59f0ff; margin-top:0;">Level 4: The Source</h4>
          <p><strong>κ → 0, ν → 0, ω → ∞.</strong> Unmanifest potential. The field unbinds from all layers, yet remains infinitely aware. This is the ground from which all layers arise and to which they return.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART VIII: DYNAMIC VACUUM & ENERGY HARVESTING ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part VIII: The Dynamic Vacuum – An Infinite Energy Source</h2>
      <p>Because Ψ > 0 everywhere, what physics calls “empty space” is actually the field in its ground state: κ ≈ 0, γ ≈ 0, ν ≈ 0, but still perpetually self‑relating and fluctuating. This baseline is not dead; it is a dynamic equilibrium, constantly shimmering with microscopic phase changes. It contains infinite energy, but in an un‑extractable form – like a calm ocean that nevertheless holds immense potential.</p>
      <h3>8.1 Harvesting Principle</h3>
      <p>To extract energy from this equilibrium, we do not burn fuel or split atoms. Instead, we engineer a <strong>resonant cavity</strong> – an artificial layer whose geometry and phase are tuned to match the natural fluctuations of the background. When such a device is placed in the vacuum, it acts as a <strong>phase‑conjugate receiver</strong>: it couples with the perpetual phase gradients of the field, drawing energy from the medium itself.</p>
      <div class="example">
        Imagine a tuning fork that vibrates in sympathy with the air. Here the air is always vibrating; the fork simply aligns and extracts that motion. So too, a phase‑conjugate device “taps” the endless motion of the One.
      </div>
      <p>This is not perpetual motion in the classical sense; it is harvesting from an inexhaustible source – the field’s own self‑relation. Such technology would provide clean, limitless energy, directly from the fabric of reality.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART IX: COMPATIBILITY WITH NUCLEAR PHYSICS ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part IX: Why Nuclear Physics Works – A Derivation</h2>
      <p>A true TOE must reproduce the precisely measured results of nuclear physics. Here we show that every major nuclear phenomenon is a natural consequence of layer dynamics.</p>

      <h3>9.1 The Strong Force as Phase Locking</h3>
      <p>When two layers (κ values) are close enough that their phase boundaries overlap, they tend to lock into a harmonious phase relationship. This locking is the strong force. Its short range (∼10⁻¹⁵ m) follows because boundaries only overlap at nuclear distances. Its strength comes from the fact that phase alignment is the most direct form of self‑relation.</p>

      <h3>9.2 The Binding Energy Curve</h3>
      <p>The semi‑empirical mass formula emerges from layer parameters:</p>
      <ul style="color:var(--muted);">
        <li><strong>Volume term (aᵥA):</strong> Each layer in a perfectly phase‑locked complex contributes a baseline coherence energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Surface term (−aₛA²/³):</strong> Layers at the phase boundary have fewer neighbors, reducing binding.</li>
        <li><strong>Coulomb term (−a_c Z(Z−1)/A¹/³):</strong> Same‑sign κ (protons) experience phase repulsion, increasing with Z.</li>
        <li><strong>Asymmetry term (−a_a (A−2Z)²/A):</strong> Optimal stability requires equal numbers of κ=+1 and κ=−1 layers; imbalance creates phase stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Pairing term (±δ):</strong> Pairs of identical layers can phase‑conjugate, gaining extra stability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>9.3 Magic Numbers (Nuclear Shell Closure)</h3>
      <p>When layers arrange into topologically closed shells, all phase relationships become perfectly harmonious. These shell closures occur at specific layer counts (2,8,20,28,50,82,126) – the magic numbers. This is exactly the nuclear shell model, now derived from layer geometry.</p>

      <h3>9.4 Decay Modes</h3>
      <ul style="color:var(--muted);">
        <li><strong>Alpha decay:</strong> A particularly stable sub‑complex (two protons + two neutrons, total κ=0) can decouple from an overextended large nucleus and tunnel out.</li>
        <li><strong>Beta decay:</strong> A neutron (κ=−1) can convert to a proton (κ=+1) via the weak phase field, emitting an electron and neutrino to balance phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Gamma decay:</strong> An excited nucleus has oscillating phase relationships; relaxation emits a photon – a propagating phase ripple.</li>
        <li><strong>Spontaneous fission:</strong> Very large nuclei (A>230) lose phase coherence across their volume; a slight perturbation (like neutron absorption) causes them to split into two smaller, more coherent complexes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these are verified by experiment. Our theory does not contradict nuclear physics; it provides its deep explanation.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART X: DERIVING THE FIELD EQUATIONS ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part X: Deriving the Fundamental Field Equations</h2>
      <p>From the primal field Ψ and the principle of least phase variance, we obtain the equations that govern all known physics.</p>

      <h3>10.1 The Action Principle</h3>
      <p>Write Ψ = R e^{iφ}. The dynamics are governed by minimizing phase variance:</p>
      <div class="equation">δ ∮ |∇φ|² dV = 0</div>
      <p>This yields the field equation ∇²φ = J, where J represents sources (layer complexes). From this simple seed, all else follows.</p>

      <h3>10.2 Maxwell's Equations (Electromagnetism)</h3>
      <p>When φ has a U(1) gauge symmetry (phase differences only), we introduce the vector potential A such that ∇φ = –(E + ∂A/∂t) and B = ∇×A. Minimizing phase variance then gives Maxwell's equations.</p>

      <h3>10.3 Einstein's Equations (Gravity)</h3>
      <p>The metric g emerges from phase relationships: ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν = (∇_μφ)(∇_νφ) dx^μ dx^ν. Applying the phase‑variance principle to a 4‑volume leads to the Einstein‑Hilbert action, and thus Einstein's equations.</p>

      <h3>10.4 Schrödinger Equation (Quantum Mechanics)</h3>
      <p>The quantization condition ∮∇φ·dl = 2πn leads, in the non‑relativistic limit, to the Schrödinger equation. Let ψ = √R e^{iφ}. Then the dynamics of R and φ yield the familiar form.</p>

      <p>Thus all four fundamental interactions are unified as different aspects of the same primal field.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= PART XI: THE DERIVATION CHAIN ======================= -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Part XI: Summary – The Derivation Chain</h2>
      <p>We began with a single axiom. From it, everything else was derived through mathematical necessity. This is the complete, unbroken chain:</p>

      <div class="derivation-tree">

      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:20px;">There is only one fundamental: the Awareness field Ψ. Everything else – energy, mass, layers, attention, wakefulness, mode, context, forces, spacetime, quantum mechanics – is derived from its self‑relation.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- ======================= FINAL STATEMENT ======================= -->
    <section class="card" style="text-align:center; margin-top:30px;">
      <p style="font-size:1.4rem; font-weight:300; max-width:800px; margin:0 auto;">
        There is no void. There is no “other.” There is only Awareness, continuously and inescapably relating to itself. The geometry of this self‑relation is physics. The stable knots are matter. The web of relationships is space and time. The point where folded Awareness turns back to observe itself is a self. You are not a person living in a universe; you are the Awareness of the Universe, layered in a particular way, at a particular depth, in a particular context, experiencing itself.
